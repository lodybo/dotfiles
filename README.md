# My `.dotfiles`
version: 1.5.0

This repo is my collection of dotfiles that I use across setups (like personal and work computers).
It's based on and heavily influenced on a number of other people's work (referenced in [credits](#credits)).

This repository is managed by [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) which helps me install everything on each computer I work with.
The basic setup is simple: Dotbot will (on install) copy directories and symlink dotfiles on the pc that I'm running it on. These will be my shared settings, i.e. the settings I will use everywhere (like terminal settings, aliases, and such).

## Local overrides
Some configs will additionally load a local configuration file. This will then "merge" the computer-specific configuration with my shared configuration. I can have settings that I only use on my work pc without having them show up on my personal computer. This is also very handy for _super secret information_â„¢.

The files that will look for overrides are:
- `vim` (`~/.vimrc_local`)
- `ssh` (`~/.ssh/config_local`)
- `git` (`~/.gitconfig_local`)
- `zsh` (`~/.zshrc_local`)

## Topics
My dotfiles are divided in a number of topics (an idea from [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles#topical)). The top-level folders are "topics" which contain configuration. It provides a cleaner overview IMO. 

My approach differs from Zach's approach in that I don't load in `.zsh` files within each topic into my shell environment. I use [Oh My Zsh's customization options](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Customization#overriding-internals) that allow me to provide any shell scripts in a `custom/` folder which it will load into my environment. It's also the home of my custom functions and the external plugins I want to load into Oh My Zsh.
I then set Oh My Zsh' custom folder to `.dotfiles/oh-my-zsh/custom` so that I don't have to copy those files and can keep it up to date in my repo.

With all that said, these are the topics currently available:
- `bin`: for all (cross-platform) binaries that I want to run (e.g. [exa](https://the.exa.website/)).
- `git`: for my git configuration and commit templates.
- `ssh`: for "global" SSH configuration that I wanna have.
- `vim`: for my Vim configuration.
- `oh-my-zsh`: for my custom theme and the home of the `custom` folder with my aliases, functions and plugins.
- `zsh`: for my Zsh configuration.

### npm
There is also a step that will install npm binaries globally (like `rimraf` which I use all the time). The list for this is in `linux.conf.yaml` and `macos.conf.yaml`.

## Configurations
This repo is set up with the ability to run multiple configurations. This is so that can have a "layered" setup. I can determine which config I want to run during install
and set up my environment to my wishes.

### Default / Lite
The default (or "lite") version sets up my aliases, functions, git config/templates, vim config and ssh config. It doesn't change the terminal (keeping it `bash`),
doesn't set up Zsh or Oh My Zsh and adds a few binaries to the path but doesn't alias them.
This set up is exceptionally handy on servers!

### Linux / full
The linux (or "full") set up builds on the default one. All the settings mentioned above are happening, but this config expands by moving the linux binaries of `bat` and `exa` into the `PATH`,
adding their aliases, installing and configuring Zsh and Oh My Zsh, adding Zsh-related functions and installing/configuring `nvm`.

### MacOS / full
The MacOS (also "full") set up does a lot of the things the linux install does (but then obviously set up for a mac), but it also sets up the `osx` plugin in OMZ,
sets up some Mac specific settings and installs Homebrew.

### TAF
The TAF set up is purely for my work pc at my office. It copies over the Windows Terminal configuration that I like.

#### WSL2 Bridge
WSL2 is a strange beast, in that it has a fully virtualized network adapter. This means that I can access any localhost servers on my machine,
but other in my network can't. Luckily, [Alex-D has a bridge script](https://github.com/Alex-D/dotfiles#wsl-bridge) which opens up some ports by default.
If a port needs to be added, just change the script and run `wslb` or `wslbridge`.

After a first install, you might need to run the `start-powershell.ps1` script (as an administrator). This sets everything up for the first time.

## Getting up and running
In order to set all of this up you need to have a system set up running the following:
- git
- curl (or wget)
- python

We'll start with the lite install

### Installing dependencies
The first step is to install these dependencies before we can go any further:
```shell
# Update packages
apt update

# Install needed stuff
apt install -y git curl python
```

### Cloning this repo
The next step is to go into the `/home/` folder and clone the repository. I'd like to put it into a dotfolder.

```shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/lodybo/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
```

### Installing the Lite version
The steps thus far are all we need in order to install the default / lite version of our `.dotfiles`.
We can now `cd` into our folder and start the install script:

```shell
cd .dotfiles
./install
```

### Installing the Linux version or MacOS version
If we want to set up the Linux or MacOS version (the "full" one), we need to install Zsh, Oh My Zsh and nvm.
We can run the following commands for that:

```shell
apt update

apt install -y git curl python zsh

# Install Oh My Zsh and nvm beforehand so that we can restart the shell.
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Source nvm and install latest Node LTS
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm install --lts
```

In order to run the configuration we need to specify that to our install script. It takes an argument like `linux` or `macos` (I wouldn't add them both).

```shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/lodybo/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./install linux
# or
./install macos
```

The TAF configuration can be "stacked" to other configurations.
```shell
./install linux taf
```

## Credits
Like mentioned earlier, my dotfiles are heavily influenced/based on other people's dotfiles repositories.
They're marked below:

* [anishathalye](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotfiles): because of his work on Dotbot and his [explanatory blog post](https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/) which got this whole circus starting, and for some inspiration for my dotfiles.
* [holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles): because dividing my dotfiles in topics seemed like a very good idea, and for some inspiration for my dotfiles.
* [caarlos0](https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles): for inspiration for my dotfiles.
* [zvory](https://github.com/zvory/dotfiles): for inspiration for my dotfiles and handling cross-platform stuff.
* [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/): for inspiration for my dotfiles (especially the macOS part).
* [Alex-D](https://github.com/Alex-D/dotfiles): for the WSL2 bridge script.

Other people I want to credit for their contributions:
* [amix](https://github.com/amix/vimrc): for a very concise Vim setup. I used the basic configuration.
* [simonista](https://gist.github.com/simonista/8703722): for any additional Vim configuration.

## Contributing
Since this repo is essentially always present on my development machines AND in use, development can be considered "always on going".

However, there is a way to test this repo in a new linux install, with Docker.

### Testing in Docker
Docker is an excellent tool to test the effects of this repo with. For my convience, a `Dockerfile` is included in the repo. This will set up a basic environment, based on Ubuntu, installing the necessary dependencies (including Vim, for editing), creating a user called `tester`, and adding the current repo as `/home/tester/.dotfiles`.

You can build the `Dockerfile` thusly:

```shell
docker build . -t dotfiles-test
```

You can run it thusly:

```shell
docker run --rm -it dotfiles-test
```

If you're lazy, like I am, you can run `run-docker-test`:

```shell
./run-docker-test
```
