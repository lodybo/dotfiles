# My `.dotfiles`

---
version: 0.1.0
---

This repo is my collection of dotfiles that I use across setups (like personal and work computers).
It's based on and heavily influenced on a number of other people's work (referenced in [credits](#credits)).

This repository is managed by [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) which helps me install everything on each computer I work with.
The basic setup is simple: Dotbot will (on install) copy directories and symlink dotfiles on the pc that I'm running it on. These will be my shared settings, i.e. the settings I will use everywhere (like terminal settings, aliases, and such).

Some configs will additionally load a local configuration file. This will then "merge" the computer-specific configuration with my shared configuration. I can have settings that I only use on my work pc without having them show up on my personal computer. This is also very handy for _super secret information_â„¢.

## Topics
My dotfiles are divided in a number of topics (an idea from [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles#topical)). The top-level folders are "topics" which contain configuration. It provides a cleaner overview IMO. 

My approach differs from Zach's approach in that I don't load in `.zsh` files within each topic into my shell environment. I use [Oh My Zsh's customization options](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Customization#overriding-internals) that allow me to provide any shell scripts in a `custom/` folder which it will load into my environment. It's also the home of my custom functions and the external plugins I want to load into Oh My Zsh.
I then set Oh My Zsh' custom folder to `.dotfiles/oh-my-zsh/custom` so that I don't have to copy those files and can keep it up to date in my repo.

With all that said, these are the topics currently available:
- `bin`: for all (cross-platform) binaries that I want to run (e.g. [exa](https://the.exa.website/)).
- `git`: for my git configuration and commit templates.
- `ssh`: for "global" SSH configuration that I wanna have.
- `vim`: for my Vim configuration.
- `oh-my-zsh`: for my custom theme and the home of the `custom` folder with my aliases, functions and plugins.
- `zsh`: for my Zsh configration.

* [holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles): because dividing my dotfiles in topics seemed like a very good idea, and for some inspiration for my dotfiles.
* [caarlos0](https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles): for inspiration for my dotfiles.
